Should I be coding?

I am actually starting to think so.

For the past 6 months I have been an apprentice at the Nashville Software School.  It has been a very challenging, but rewarding experience.  NSS is great and unlike any other school or university I have attended, everyone cares.  From the top down.  Everyone is willing to lend a hand and offer advice and guidance.  Everyone is trying to make a difference, but no one is the same and we are from all walks of life.  There's the 18 year old kid that has just finished high school and then there is the retiree looking for another challenge.  As usual, I fit somewhere in between.

I plan to describe my experiences at NSS and to help offer guidence and insight on what to expect from the program.  Stay tuned.
